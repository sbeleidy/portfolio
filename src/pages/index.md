Hi! I'm Saad Elbeleidy, a generalist software engineer turned researcher. I'm currently working on [research](/research) to improve teleoperation interfaces for robot-assisted therapy at the [MIRRORLab](https://mirrorlab.mines.edu) in collaboration with [Peerbots](https://peerbots.org). Up until recently, I was fairly focused on [machine learning](/machine-learning) as well.

In the past, I've worked as a variety of different roles across product management, software engineering, and data science.
