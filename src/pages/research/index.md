  heading: Improving Teleoperation Interfaces to Support Therapists in
    Robot-Assisted Therapy
  description: Socially assistive robots (SARs) receive significant research
    attention due to their positive impact across many contexts. SARs are often
    teleoperated by a caregiver (therapist) who controls the robot's motion and
    dialogue. My research focuses on the interfaces used to control these robots
    and specifically looks at four main questions.
conclusion: Interested in this research? Please reach out!
