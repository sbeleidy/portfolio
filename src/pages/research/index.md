  heading: Improving Teleoperation Interfaces to Support Therapists in
    Robot-Assisted Therapy
  description: Socially assistive robots (SARs) receive significant research
    attention due to their positive impact across many contexts. SARs are often
    teleoperated by a caregiver (therapist) who controls the robot's motion and
    dialogue. My research focuses on the interfaces used to control these robots
    and specifically looks at four main questions.
conclusion: Interested in this research? Please reach out at selbeleidy@mines.edu!

### \[RQ1] What Level of Autonomy is appropriate for Socially Assistive Robots?

Researchers on Level of Robot Autonomy (LoA) have provided guidelines for roboticists and robot researchers to follow when selecting their robots' LoA. We looked through papers on Socially Assistive Robots published from 2016-2021 at the HRI conference and THRI journal to understand how researchers choose their robots' LoA and to what extent that matches LoA selection guidelines. You can find our findings in our paper published at AltHRI'22.

### \[RQ2] How are SAR systems used in robot-assisted therapy for autistic children?

Socially Assistive Robots currently used to support autistic children are often teleoperated by a therapist or caregiver. We obtained data from [Fine Art Miracles](https://fineartmiracles.com/), a nonprofit service organization that supports vulnerable populations, of therapists using SARs to deliver social skills programs to groups of autistic children. We identified 5 major themes of content that therapists use and several important patterns about those. You can find out more about these by reading our paper published at IDC'21.

### \[RQ3] What are therapists’ needs in conducting therapy for autistic children, including when teleoperating robots?





### \[RQ4] What interface capabilities can meet therapists’ needs in operating a robot in therapy with autistic children?
