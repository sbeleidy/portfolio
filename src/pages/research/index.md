  heading: Improving Teleoperation Interfaces to Support Therapists in
    Robot-Assisted Therapy
  description: Socially assistive robots (SARs) receive significant research
    attention due to their positive impact across many contexts. SARs are often
    teleoperated by a caregiver (therapist) who controls the robot's motion and
    dialogue. My research focuses on the interfaces used to control these robots
    and specifically looks at four main questions.
conclusion: Interested in this research? Please reach out!

### \[RQ1] What Level of Autonomy is appropriate for Socially Assistive Robots?

Researchers on Level of Robot Autonomy (LoA) have provided guidelines for roboticists and robot researchers to follow when selecting their robots' LoA. We looked through papers on Socially Assistive Robots published from 2016-2021 at the HRI conference and THRI journal to understand how researchers choose their robots' LoA and to what extent that matches LoA selection guidelines. You can find our findings, published at AltHRI'22 in the following paper:

### \[RQ3] What are therapists’ needs in conducting therapy for autistic children, including when teleoperating robots?

### \[RQ4] What interface capabilities can meet therapists’ needs in operating a robot in therapy with autistic children?
