        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

  heading: Improving Teleoperation Interfaces to Support Therapists in
    Robot-Assisted Therapy
  description: Socially assistive robots (SARs) receive significant research
    attention due to their positive impact across many contexts. SARs are often
    teleoperated by a caregiver (therapist) who controls the robot's motion and
    dialogue. My research focuses on the interfaces used to control these robots
    and specifically looks at four main questions.
